Dude, just got back from watching Mountainhead, and wow, what a freaking ride. Like, I don't even know where to begin. You ever watch something and think, What did I just see? But in a good way? That's exactly how I'm feeling right now. Seriously, the scenery alone was enough to make me want to grab my stuff and disappear into the mountains, although I'm way too lazy for that kind of thing, haha.

The story, man! Talk about twists and turns. Felt like every time I thought I knew what was happening, bam, another curveball. Don't even get me started on the main character. One minute you love him, the next you're like, Dude, what are you doing? I guess that’s what makes it so gripping, you know what I mean? I didn't see that ending coming at all. Like, what even was that?

> Right around the middle, I realized I should've downloaded the movie earlier instead of streaming it cuz the internet kept glitching. So annoying, but whatever. Still stuck it out even with the occasional buffering. Because that's how you know a movie's good, when you're willing to just roll with the tech hiccups for the sake of the story. Anyway, I should've learned by now that streaming on my old junk is a gamble, lol.

Oh, and let me just say, the soundtrack was fire. Completely unexpected but really set the mood, you know? There's nothing like an epic soundtrack to make those mountain scenes even crazier. Now I'm just here wondering if I should look up the composer, like, Who are you and how did you just read my brain? Haha.

There were definitely some WTF moments, too. Like, this one part where a character just goes off on some weird tangent. I mean, it makes sense later, kind of, but at the moment I'm just sitting there going, Okaaay, if you say so, buddy. But that's part of the charm, I guess? Sometimes you just need a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.

function randomThought() {
  return Math.random() > 0.5 ? Time to make some popcorn. : I should really get some sleep.;
}

So yeah, if you get a chance, definitely watch the movie. It's worth it, trust me. Or maybe not, and I just have a weird taste in films, haha. Whatever, just let me know what you think when you do. I'm on a rollercoaster of emotions over here, and I need someone else in this mess with me.
